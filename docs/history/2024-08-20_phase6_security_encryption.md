## Request Title: Security Implementation with Advanced Encryption

## Feature Name: AES-256-GCM Encryption and Authentication System

### Client Request
**Date:** 2024-08-20  
**Requested by:** Security Requirements  
**Request Description:**
Need to encrypt OTP secrets for security compliance. Initial requirement was for biometric authentication, but Chrome extension limitations required alternative secure authentication method.

### Proposed Plans/Approach
**Analysis Date:** 2024-08-20  
**Proposed Solutions:**
1. **WebAuthn API Implementation** - Use biometric authentication
   - Pros: Modern, secure, user-friendly
   - Cons: Not supported in Chrome extension context
2. **System Password Verification** - Verify actual system passwords
   - Pros: Familiar to users
   - Cons: Cannot verify system passwords from browser context
3. **PIN/Password with Verification Token System** - Custom secure authentication
   - Pros: User-friendly, secure, compatible with extension limitations
   - Cons: Additional complexity in implementation

**Recommended Approach:**
PIN/Password with verification token system using AES-256-GCM encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation.

### Implementation Details
**Implementation Date:** 2024-08-20  
**Developer:** Tareq Nassry  

**Technical Analysis:**
- Chrome extension security limitations require custom solution
- Need cryptographically secure encryption without password storage
- Verification token system provides security without storing sensitive data
- PBKDF2 with high iteration count prevents brute force attacks

**Solution Iterations:**
1. **Initial WebAuthn Attempt**: Failed due to Chrome extension API limitations
2. **System Password Approach**: Abandoned due to browser security restrictions
3. **Final PIN/Password Solution**: Successful implementation with verification tokens

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Implement AES-256-GCM encryption with Web Crypto API
2. Add PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
3. Create verification token system (random UUID encrypted with user PIN)
4. Implement authentication flow (setup → encrypt token → store encrypted + plain tokens)
5. Add login verification (decrypt token → verify match → grant access)
6. Update storage to encrypt all OTP secrets before saving
7. Implement secure memory cleanup after operations

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `js/crypto.js` - New file with complete encryption system
- `js/popup.js` - Integrated authentication flow and PIN management
- `js/storage.js` - Added encryption integration for all data storage
- `popup.html` - Added authentication UI elements

**Database Changes:**
- Added encrypted verification tokens to Chrome storage
- All OTP secrets now stored in encrypted format
- Authentication metadata stored securely

### Testing & Validation
**Testing Approach:**
- Encryption/decryption cycle testing with various key lengths
- Authentication flow testing with correct and incorrect PINs
- Security validation of stored data in chrome.storage.local
- Performance testing of PBKDF2 key derivation

**Validation Results:**
- All OTP secrets properly encrypted before storage
- Authentication system prevents unauthorized access
- Wrong password attempts properly rejected
- Encrypted data verified as non-readable in storage inspection

### Deployment Notes
**Deployment Date:** 2024-08-20  
**Environment:** development  

**Post-Deployment:**
- All existing accounts automatically encrypted on first authentication
- Users required to set up PIN/password on first use after update
- No data loss during encryption transition

### Lessons Learned
**What Worked Well:**
- Verification token system balances security with usability
- AES-256-GCM provides military-grade encryption
- PBKDF2 with high iteration count prevents brute force
- No password storage eliminates major security risk

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could investigate alternative biometric APIs for extensions in future
- Might add password strength requirements
- Could implement session timeout for additional security

**Knowledge Gained:**
- Chrome extension API limitations require creative security solutions
- Verification by decryption is more secure than password storage
- Web Crypto API provides robust encryption capabilities in browser context
- User-friendly security (simple PIN allowed) doesn't compromise actual security
