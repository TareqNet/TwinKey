# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Design: Simple, recognizable shield/lock icon representing OTP security
- Colors: Should match the extension's theme (blue primary color: #007bff)

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, you can:
1. Use any existing 16px, 48px, and 128px PNG files
2. Rename them to match the required names
3. Place them in this directory

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show default placeholder icons.
